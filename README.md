# Robieo
game by Mark Oates


## About

This game is my submission to KrampusHack 2023.

In this game you play as Robieo, a delivery robot who works for (and was created by) the brilliant Dr. Louise.  Your job is to deliver packages one by one to the recipients in each of the levels.

There are 8 levels.  I recommend playing them in order (though you can play through them in any order you want).  There is no tracking of which levels you have played, so you may need to keep which level you last played in mind as you go through them.

Once you have delivered packages in each of the levels, the game will go to the closing credits and you win!

I am the secret santa for... promitheas

His wish was as follows:

Hello,
So this is my first time so I hope I'm not messing anything up... I don't want to ask for anything really hard so I guess for this year, I'm going to ask :
i) For some music, if possible, include some Christmas themed music in the game
ii) to have a game that's themed around kindness (for examplrle, if possible avoid having a game about "killing enemies")
Have fun!



## Gameplay

Joystick is recommended

The gameplay is very simple.  Move the character around with the joystick (or ARROW KEYS on a keyboard).  You can advance dialog and select menu options by pressing any button on the joystick (or ENTER on the keyboard).

To quit the game, press ESCAPE on the keyboard.


## Performance

There are not many graphics optimizations, so I hope it will run well on your machine.  Occasionally, I have noticed the frames will get a bit "jittery" (something to do with the primary timer getting shifted out of sync during gameplay).  If this happens, you can "nudge" the game timer forward by 1/10 of a frame with "SHIFT + ." OR, press the right bumper button on the controller (XBOX 360, may be a different button on other controllers.) You may need to nudge it a couple of times.


Thank you for playing my game!
